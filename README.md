# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:


An analysis was performed over PyBerâ€™s rideshare data segmented into three locations: Urban, Suburban, and Rural communities. The data includes details such as number of trips, number of drivers, and number of riders. PyBer wants to gain an understanding of the existing rideshare data in order to improve access to ride sharing services and increased underserved communities. The following analysis will help determine where improvements can be made.



## Results:

Based on the analysis, it was noted that total rides, total drivers, and total fares were significantly higher for Urban and Suburban communities in comparison to the Rural sector. Rural communities, however, had much higher average fares per ride and per driver in comparison to the Urban and Suburban communities.

## Summary:

The results shown above indicate rural communities are being underserved. Lower supply in the rural community has led to higher average fares in comparison to urban and suburban communities. To assist in improving these statistics, PyBer should analyze the rural community closer and consider increasing recruitment among those seeking employment. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the roads and determine how routes and ride-sharing stops can increased or put in different locations for easier access. Surveys may be helpful in generating some of this data as well as talking with people in the community about their commuting habits.
